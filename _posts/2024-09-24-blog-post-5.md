Had a great time at the GSK PhD symposium held in the London King's Cross office! [My poster](/files/poster_hyt_GSK_240924.pdf) titled "Blessing of Dimensionality in Natural Data" won the poster prize amongst other GSK-sponsored PhD students around the world. Slides available [pptx](/files/presentation_hyt_GSK_240924.pptx) [pdf](/files/presentation_hyt_GSK_240924.pdf).
