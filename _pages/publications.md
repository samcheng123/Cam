My current focus is on deep learning for PDEs, such as neural opearator for PDE soluition, and the application of neural ODEs. In addition, I also work on Visoon Language model, medical imaging, inverser problem and diffusion models.  See my publication for more details*

I’m open to collaborations in all forms related to my research interest and would love to explore any opportunities! Feel free to contact me by Email cwc56[AT] cam.ac.uk. Collaborating with me offers several potential benefits: [1] Research Publications: You’ll have the opportunity to co-author research papers, potentially contributing to high-impact journals and conferences, provided that you commit and work diligently. [2] Collaborative and Supportive Network: You’ll get the chance to work with renowned supervisors like Dr. Angelica I. Aviles-Rivero and Prof. Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb, as well as strong collaborators from Cambridge University and beyond.
