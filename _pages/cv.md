Research Experience
======
* 2024 Jan-2024 Mar: Research Intern at BBC - Computer Vision Team
  * Developed the Watermarked Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network (W-VQGAN), an innovative
    framework for embedding and detecting watermarks in GAN-generated images, ensuring digital media authenticity
    and integrity.
  * The approach involves three key stages: image generation via VQGAN, unique watermark embedding within the
    codebook, and precise watermark detection through token extraction and codebook comparison.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Juil Sock, Dr. Marc G´orriz Blanch and Dr. Woody Bayliss (BBC)

* 2023 Jul-Aug: Research Assistan at City University of Hong Kong - Department of Mathematics
  * Fin-tech Research about mathematical finance and prompt engineering.
