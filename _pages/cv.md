<!-- * B.S. in GitHub, GitHub University, 2012 -->

Research Experience
======
* 2024 Jan-2024 Mar: Research Intern at BBC - Computer Vision Team
  * Developed the Watermarked Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network (W-VQGAN), an innovative
    framework for embedding and detecting watermarks in GAN-generated images, ensuring digital media authenticity
    and integrity.
  * The approach involves three key stages: image generation via VQGAN, unique watermark embedding within the
    codebook, and precise watermark detection through token extraction and codebook comparison.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Juil Sock, Dr. Marc G´orriz Blanch and Dr. Woody Bayliss (BBC)

* 2022 Aug- 2023 April: Final Year Project at City University of Hong Kong - Department of Mathematics
  * Fin-tech Research about mathematical finance and prompt engineering.
  * Supervisors: [Professor Raymond H. Chan](https://www.ln.edu.hk/po/people/professor-raymond-chan-hon-fu)

* 2023 Jul- 2023 Aug: Research Assistan at City University of Hong Kong - Department of Mathematics
  * Shape Reconstruction via a machine learning approach
  * Try to build a new approach, combine NODE with shape reconstruction from a picture
  * Supervisors: [Professor Hongyu Liu (CityU)](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/hyliu.htm)
