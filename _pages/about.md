* 15-10-2024, Invited talk in CityU mathematics department. [Link](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/ma/sites/g/files/asqsls6306/files/2024-10/col_20241015.pdf)

Who are I?
======
My name is Chun Wun but people usaully call me Sam, and I am a 2nd and PhD student in the [Cambridge Image Analysis](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/cia/cambridge-image-analysis) group, Co -supervised by [Prof. Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/person/cbs31) and [Dr Angelica Aviles Rivero](https://angelicaiaviles.wordpress.com/). My phd was fully Funded by [Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)](https://www.snf.ch/en/FKhU9kAtfXx7w9AI/page/home) for four years. I am currently looking for summer intern in 2025 summer.

Research Interest and Collberation:
======
My current focus is on deep learning for PDEs, such as neural opearator for PDE soluition, and the application of neural ODEs. In addition, I also work on Visoon Language model, medical imaging, inverser problem and diffusion models.  See my publication for more details*

I’m open to collaborations in all forms related to my research interest and would love to explore any opportunities! Feel free to contact me by Email <b>cwc56@cam.ac.uk</b>. Collaborating with me offers several potential benefits: <b>[1]</b> Research Publications: You’ll have the opportunity to co-author research papers, potentially contributing to high-impact journals and conferences, provided that you commit and work diligently. <b>[2]</b> Collaborative and Supportive Network: You’ll get the chance to work with renowned supervisors like Dr. Angelica I. Aviles-Rivero and Prof. Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb, as well as strong collaborators from Cambridge University and beyond.
